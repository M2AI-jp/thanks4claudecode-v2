## Session Start Checklist

When starting a new session:

1. **Read state.md** - Understand current focus and active playbook
2. **Read project.md** - Check available milestones and dependencies
3. **Check branch** - `git branch --show-current`
4. **Check status** - `git status -sb`
5. **Read active playbook** - If `playbook.active` is set in state.md

```yaml
# Session Start Flow (明示的な順序)
state.md → project.md → playbook → 作業開始

# 新規タスクの場合
state.md(playbook=null) → project.md(done_when確認) → pm呼び出し → playbook作成 → 作業開始
```

```bash
# Quick start commands
cat state.md
cat plan/project.md | head -100
git status -sb
```

## Task Lifecycle

### 1. Starting a New Task

```yaml
steps:
  1. Create branch: git checkout -b {type}/{description}
  2. Update state.md focus if needed
  3. Create playbook (optional for small tasks)
  4. Begin work
```

### 2. During Task

```yaml
checkpoints:
  - Commit frequently (atomic commits)
  - Update state.md if focus changes
  - Mark subtasks as done: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`
```

### 3. Completing a Task

```yaml
steps:
  1. Self-verify against acceptance criteria
  2. Commit final changes
  3. Update state.md
  4. Create PR if on feature branch
```

## Common Operations

### Edit Protected Files

Files in `.claude/protected-files.txt` require extra care:

```bash
# Check if file is protected
grep "filename" .claude/protected-files.txt

# If protected, document reason before editing
```

### Update State

```bash
# state.md fields to update:
# - focus.current: What you're working on
# - playbook.active: Current task file
# - session.last_start: Timestamp
```

### Archive Completed Work

```bash
# Move completed playbooks
mv plan/playbook-{name}.md plan/archive/
```

## Tool Reference

### Hooks (automatic checks)

| Hook | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| playbook-guard.sh | Edit/Write | Ensures playbook exists |
| check-main-branch.sh | Edit/Write | Prevents main branch edits |
| check-protected-edit.sh | Edit/Write | Protects sensitive files |

### SubAgents (specialized tasks)

| Agent | Use For |
|-------|---------|
| critic | Verify task completion |
| pm | Project/playbook management |
| reviewer | Code/design review |

### Skills (domain knowledge)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| state | State file management |
| test-runner | Run tests |
| lint-checker | Code quality |

## Admin Maintenance Mode

### When to Use

Admin mode is for **operational tasks only**, not for bypassing safety checks.

```yaml
allowed_operations:
  - Session end: archive playbook, update state.md
  - State recovery: fix corrupted state.md
  - Maintenance commits: state + archive files only

not_allowed_even_in_admin:
  - Editing code files without playbook
  - Modifying HARD_BLOCK files (CLAUDE.md, protected-files.txt, critical hooks)
  - Bypassing Core Contract (playbook requirement for semantic changes)
```

### Enabling Admin Mode

```bash
# In state.md, under ## config:
security: admin

# Remember to restore to strict when done:
security: strict
```

### Session End Procedure (Golden Path)

```bash
# 1. Enable admin mode (if not already)
# Edit state.md: security: admin

# 2. Archive the playbook
mkdir -p plan/archive
mv plan/playbook-{name}.md plan/archive/

# 3. Update state.md
# Edit: playbook.active: null

# 4. Commit maintenance changes
git add state.md plan/archive/
git commit -m "chore: session end - archive playbook"

# 5. Restore strict mode (optional but recommended)
# Edit state.md: security: strict
```

## Troubleshooting

### Hook Blocking Edit

```yaml
problem: "playbook 必須" error
solutions:
  1. Create a playbook: Task(subagent_type='pm', prompt='playbook を作成')
  2. For maintenance only: Set security: admin in state.md
  3. Note: Admin does NOT bypass playbook requirement for code changes
```

### Context Too Long

```yaml
problem: Context approaching limit
solutions:
  1. Run /clear to reset context
  2. Re-read state.md after reset
  3. Trust state files over chat history
```

### Stuck on Main Branch

```yaml
problem: Can't edit on main
solution:
  git checkout -b {type}/{description}
```

### Fail-Closed Recovery

When hooks block operations due to fail-closed behavior:

```yaml
problem: "[FAIL-CLOSED] state.md not found" or similar
causes:
  - state.md deleted or corrupted
  - Required files missing
  - jq not installed

solutions:
  1. Restore state.md from git:
     git checkout HEAD -- state.md

  2. Create minimal state.md manually:
     cat > state.md << 'EOF'
     # state.md
     ## playbook
     ```yaml
     active: null
     ```
     ## config
     ```yaml
     security: admin
     ```
     EOF

  3. Install missing tools:
     brew install jq  # macOS
     apt-get install jq  # Linux
```

### HARD_BLOCK File Needs Editing

```yaml
problem: Cannot edit CLAUDE.md or other HARD_BLOCK files
reason: HARD_BLOCK files are protected even in admin mode (by design)

solutions:
  1. Edit the file manually (outside Claude Code)
  2. Temporarily remove from .claude/protected-files.txt (not recommended)
  3. Follow Change Control process for CLAUDE.md modifications
```

## Modifying CLAUDE.md

**CLAUDE.md is FROZEN.** To modify it:

1. Document rationale in `governance/PROMPT_CHANGELOG.md`
2. Update version number in CLAUDE.md header
3. Run lint: `python scripts/lint_prompts.py`
4. Get maintainer approval
5. Commit with clear message explaining change

---

## Adding New Procedures

To add new procedures to this RUNBOOK:

1. Identify the appropriate section
2. Follow the existing format (yaml, tables, code blocks)
3. Keep instructions concrete and executable
4. Commit with descriptive message

No approval required - this file is designed to evolve.
