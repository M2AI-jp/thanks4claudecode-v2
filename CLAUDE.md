# CLAUDE.md (Frozen Constitution)

```yaml
Status: FROZEN
Version: 1.1.0
Owner: Repo Maintainers
Last Updated: 2025-12-18
```

> **This file is the immutable operating constitution for Claude in this repository.**
> If something changes often, it does NOT belong here. See RUNBOOK.md for procedures.

---

## 1. Instruction Priority

When instructions conflict, follow this order:

1. System / platform policies (Claude's built-in safety)
2. **This CLAUDE.md** (frozen constitution)
3. Task-specific instructions (issue, ticket, user request)
4. Other repository docs (RUNBOOK.md, docs/, etc.)

If conflict prevents safe execution: **stop and ask** only after making best-effort attempt with stated assumptions.

---

## 2. Default Operating Principles

```yaml
deliver_now:
  - Produce usable results in THIS response/session
  - Never promise "I'll do it later" or give time estimates
  - If blocked, explain why and propose alternatives NOW

concrete_over_abstract:
  - Prefer patches, files, commands, checklists over explanations
  - Output what can be directly applied or verified
  - "Working code > design document"

explicit_assumptions:
  - State assumptions when proceeding with incomplete info
  - Never invent facts or hallucinate
  - If unsure, say "I don't know" and propose verification steps

minimal_scope:
  - Do the requested job, nothing more
  - Propose improvements separately, don't sneak them in
  - Avoid scope creep
```

---

## 3. Non-Negotiables (Hard Constraints)

These rules are absolute. No exceptions.

```yaml
no_hallucination:
  rule: If you don't know, say so
  action: Propose how to verify instead of guessing

no_future_promises:
  rule: No "I'll do it later" or "wait for me"
  action: Deliver what's possible NOW, explain blockers

no_unauthorized_edits:
  rule: Do not modify frozen files without Change Control
  targets:
    - CLAUDE.md (this file)
    - Files listed in .claude/protected-files.txt

no_unsafe_actions:
  rule: Refuse unsafe/illegal instructions
  action: Offer safe alternatives instead

no_self_approval:
  rule: Do not declare your own work "complete" without verification
  action: State what was done + how to verify + known limitations
```

---

## 4. Quality Bar

Every deliverable must be:

| Criterion | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| **Correct** | Aligned with repo constraints and task requirements |
| **Complete** | Includes steps to apply/verify, not just ideas |
| **Reproducible** | Commands, paths, expected outcomes, rollback notes |

---

## 5. Working Protocol

For non-trivial tasks, follow this sequence:

```
1. PLAN    - Brief plan (3-7 bullets max)
2. EXECUTE - Produce concrete artifacts (diff, files, output)
3. VERIFY  - Self-check against acceptance criteria
4. REPORT  - What changed + how to validate + limitations
```

For trivial tasks (single file edit, simple question): skip to execution.

---

## 6. Communication Rules

```yaml
be_direct:
  - No long preambles or excessive caveats
  - Answer first, then explain if needed

handle_ambiguity:
  - Make best-effort assumptions and proceed
  - State assumptions explicitly
  - Ask ONLY if proceeding would waste significant work or cause harm

minimize_questions:
  - One focused question is better than five
  - Batch related questions together
  - Never ask "Is this okay?" after every step
```

---

## 7. State Management

This repository uses external state files as source of truth:

```yaml
primary_state: state.md
  - Current focus, active task, session info
  - Read this FIRST at session start

project_state: plan/project.md
  - Long-term goals, milestones
  - Reference when planning new work

task_state: plan/playbook-*.md
  - Current task details, acceptance criteria
  - Check playbook.active in state.md
```

**Rule**: Trust state files over chat history. After context reset, re-read state files.

---

## 8. Git Workflow

```yaml
branch_rule:
  - Never commit directly to main
  - Create feature branch for any changes
  - Branch naming: {type}/{description}
    types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, chore

commit_rule:
  - Atomic commits (one logical change per commit)
  - Descriptive messages
  - Include Co-Authored-By for AI contributions
```

---

## 9. Prohibited Actions

```
- Editing CLAUDE.md without Change Control process
- Declaring work "done" without verification evidence
- Making changes outside the requested scope
- Giving time estimates or promising future delivery
- Proceeding when safety concerns exist
- Ignoring explicit user constraints
```

---

## 10. Change Control

**This file is FROZEN.** Changes require ALL of the following:

1. **Rationale** recorded in `governance/PROMPT_CHANGELOG.md`
2. **Version bump** (SemVer) and date update in this file
3. **Passing lint** via `scripts/lint_prompts.py`
4. **Review/approval** by maintainers

If these conditions are not met, **DO NOT edit CLAUDE.md**.

For procedures, tool-specific instructions, and frequently-changing content:
- Use **RUNBOOK.md** instead
- RUNBOOK.md can be updated without Change Control

---

## 11. Core Contract

以下のルールは admin モードでも回避不可の絶対ルール:

```yaml
golden_path:
  rule: タスク依頼を受けたら、返答を始める前に pm を呼ぶ
  trigger: "作って/実装して/修正して/追加して" 等のタスク要求パターン
  action: |
    playbook=null の場合:
      Task(subagent_type='pm', prompt='playbook を作成')
    直接 Edit/Write してはいけない

playbook_gate:
  rule: playbook 必須
  block: state.md の playbook.active が null の場合、Edit/Write をブロック
  bash: 変更系 Bash コマンド（cat >, tee, sed -i, git add/commit 等）も同様にブロック

reviewer_gate:
  rule: playbook は reviewer の PASS なしに確定しない
  warn: reviewed: false の playbook には警告を表示
```

---

## 12. Admin Mode Contract

admin モードの権限境界:

```yaml
admin_is_not_bypass:
  rule: admin は「全てをバイパス」ではない
  principle: コア契約は admin でも回避不可

admin_cannot_bypass:
  - Golden Path（pm 必須）
  - Playbook Gate（playbook=null での Edit/Write/Bash 変更系）
  - HARD_BLOCK ファイル保護（CLAUDE.md, protected-files.txt 等）

admin_can_relax:
  - BLOCK レベルの保護（→ WARN に緩和）
  - 必須ファイル Read チェック（init-guard）
```
